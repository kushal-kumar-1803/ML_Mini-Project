# Deep Queue-Learning: A Quest to Optimize Office Hours

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learningâ€“based Smart Queue Scheduling System** using **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**.  
The system intelligently manages task queues by learning optimal scheduling policies through interaction with a simulated environment.

**Course:** UE23CS352A Machine Learning  
**Project Type:** College Mini Project  
**Team Members:**
- **Kushal Kumar B** [PES1UG23AM155]  
- **Laasya R** [PES1UG23AM157]  

**Goal:** Optimize queue scheduling using Deep Reinforcement Learning.  
**Algorithm:** Deep Q-Learning (DQN)  
**Environment:** Custom-built `QueueEnvironment` using Python and Gym

## Problem Definition

Traditional queue scheduling (FIFO, Round Robin, etc.) doesnâ€™t adapt dynamically to changing system loads.  
The objective here is to design an **adaptive scheduler** that can **learn** and **improve over time**, achieving better throughput and lower waiting times using reinforcement learning.

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1.Reinforcement Learning Setup

The system is modeled as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**:

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **State (S)** | Current queue lengths, waiting times, and task properties |
| **Action (A)** | Which queue or task to serve next |
| **Reward (R)** | Positive reward for reducing queue time, penalty for delays |
| **Policy (Ï€)** | Strategy learned by the DQN model to pick optimal actions |

---

### 2.Deep Q-Network (DQN)

The DQN approximates the **Q-value function** using a neural network:

- **Input:** Current state (queue metrics)
- **Hidden Layers:** 2 fully connected layers with ReLU activation  
- **Output:** Q-values for all possible actions  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- **Exploration:** Îµ-greedy (starts high and decays over episodes)

---

## 3.Training Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|------------|--------|
| Episodes | 10 |
| Steps per Episode | 200 |
| Learning Rate | 0.001 |
| Discount Factor (Î³) | 0.95 |
| Epsilon Decay | 0.995 |
| Batch Size | 32 |

During training, the agent interacts with the environment, learns from rewards, and updates the Q-network accordingly.

Conclusion

The Smart Queue Scheduler effectively learned optimal scheduling behavior using reinforcement learning.
With more episodes and hyperparameter tuning, performance can improve further, approaching an ideal adaptive scheduler.

Future Improvements
